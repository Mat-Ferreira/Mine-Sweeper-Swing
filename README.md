## Running the game

To run the game, you will need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine. You can check if you have the JRE installed by opening a terminal and running:

>java -version


If you do not have the JRE installed, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

Once you have the JRE installed, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game and run the following command:

>java -jar MineSweeper.jar

This will launch the game.

## Playing the game

The objective of the game is to uncover all the cells on the board that do not contain mines. You can left-click a cell to uncover it, and right-click to mark it as containing a mine. If you uncover a cell that contains a mine, the game is over.

The numbers on the board indicate the number of mines in the surrounding cells. Use this information to help you identify where the mines are and plan your moves accordingly.

## Options

After every game the player will have the option to play again or quit.
